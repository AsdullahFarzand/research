| **CWE** | Common Weakness Enumeration | Paper 2 |
| **CVE** | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures | Paper 2 |
| **CVSS** | Common Vulnerability Scoring System | Paper 2 |

### A.2 Key Formulas

#### CVSS v3.1 (Paper 2)
```
CVSS Base Score = [Scope Unchanged] ? min(Impact + Exploitability, 10) : min(1.08 * (Impact + Exploitability), 10)
Impact = 1 - [(1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A)]
Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI
```

#### Enterprise Risk Score (Paper 5)
```
Risk Score = (CVSS × 0.4) + (Exploitability × 0.25) + (Asset Criticality × 0.25) + (Threat Intel × 0.1)
```

#### Portfolio Risk Aggregation (Paper 5)
```
Portfolio Risk = Σ(Individual Vulnerability Risk) / Total Vulnerabilities
Portfolio Health = 100 - (Portfolio Risk × 10)
```

### A.3 Critical Timelines

#### Discovery to Remediation (Paper 3)
```
Critical:   0 → 24 hours
High:       0 → 7 days
Medium:     0 → 30 days
Low:        0 → 90 days
```

#### Lifecycle Phases (Paper 3)
```
Detection → Validation → Classification → Planning → Implementation → Verification → Closure
1-2 days    1-3 days    1 day           1-3 days   1-30 days       1-7 days       1 day
```

### A.4 Configuration Recommendations

#### Minimum Tool Stack
```
Paper 1 & 3: SAST (SonarQube) + DAST (OWASP ZAP) + SCA (Snyk)
Paper 4:     ML orchestration platform + patch automation framework
Paper 5:     Enterprise vulnerability management platform (Qualys/Tenable)
```

#### Recommended Scanning Frequency
```
SAST:        Per commit (CI/CD integration)
DAST:        Daily + post-deployment
SCA:         Per build + weekly
Infrastructure: Weekly
Compliance:  Monthly
Threat Intel: Continuous
```
